## Using pre-trained models to detect depression and anxiety from twitter dataset

The whole Project was done in Lighting AI.(Lighting AI is a cloud based virtual envirnment that offers AI development platforms)
I have used Hugging Face access token for every pre-trained model to train my dataset.

P.S. LLAMA-7b was too big I couldn't train the model, but all the other models that I used are lightweight and worked for me
